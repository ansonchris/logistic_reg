1.	Add a weight configuration option to the logistic regression module.
2.	Add an Offset option, which supports fixing the model coefficient corresponding to the specified variable to 1 or a specific value, the above two will adjust oversampling in binary logistic model.
3.	Compare the model runtime of the same dataset in both SAS and Python environments.
4.	Support direct input of variable interaction terms (e.g., X1*X2) during regression modeling.
5.	Put a data check before regression estimation: output a corresponding variable abnormality alert when the variables involved in the regression equation contain missing values or infinite values.
6.	Optimize the variable rules for Stepwise regression: Set the Initial list as the "mandatory included variable list" and the remove list as the "mandatory excluded variable list"—both remain fixed throughout the regression process.
7.	Compare the variables selected by Stepwise regression with those selected by models such as XGBoost.
